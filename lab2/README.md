Dataset & Machine Learning Problem Summary
The dataset used in this project is the House Prices dataset, which contains information about residential properties along with their corresponding sale prices. The features describe various characteristics of the houses, such as size, location-related attributes, and structural details. The machine learning task is a supervised regression problem, where the goal is to train a model that can accurately predict house prices based on these features. This helps evaluate how different property attributes influence housing prices and the overall performance of predictive models.
