Amazon Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Amazon sales dataset. Following the principles of Lab 3, it focuses on data cleaning, uncovering sales patterns, and visualizing key business metrics.

The goal of this analysis is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights. By cleaning the data and applying visualization techniques, we identify:
1- Sales Trends: How revenue fluctuates over time.
2- Product Performance: Which categories and brands drive the most profit.
3- Customer Behavior: Preferred payment methods and order quantities.
